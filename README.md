# Epidemicon

Epidemicon is an agent-based model for simulating disease (such as Covid-19) spread around the city. We used data exported from Open Street Map to generate the environment, while the agents are simulating the movement of people that live inside the simulated environment. The agents are generated within housing buildings (Apartment, Residential, House) and will travel around the map based on their needs or profession. For example, Teacher and student will go to school during specific hour, or people will go to restaurant if they are hungry.

The goal of this project is to provide a simulated environment to test different policies such as Localized lockdown, curfew for business, and different vaccination rate. Some of this features are still under development and will be updated in the future.
